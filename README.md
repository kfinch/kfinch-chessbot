kfinch-chessbot
===============

kfinch's chessbot! Contains a framework for running a game of chess, a frontend, and a bot.

Apart from the back-end chess framework, the source is currently a mess! Sorry, I'm working on that.

TODO:
High Priority -
  Think of more things to add to this todo list  =)
  Create a more sensible frontend for basic gaming / testing (this will probably requrie class restructuring).
  Create a testing suite for harder to test features.

Low Priority - 
  Use Zobrist hashing feature to implement use of transposition tables during game tree search.
  Fiddle with evaluator to optimize performance.
  Allow an option that adds more 'randomness' to bots moves.
  Enable server to detect and handle loops of repeated moves.
